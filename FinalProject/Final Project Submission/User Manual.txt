This is the user manual for the tkinter website builder by Gabriel Abney.

First, extract the zipped files from this folder, including the images.

Run the finaltkinterprojectgabrielabney.py application to launch the GUI application.

The homepage has buttons to allow you to continue, exit, or open documentation on running the website.

Opening the website builder window shows several locations for users to enter data.
These data will be used to create the website later on.  Make sure to save before building the website!

After saving and building the website, open the .html document that was created in the same folder as the finaltkinterproject.py application.  This .html document should display a web page in a browser, and can be run on a web server with no additional formatting.
